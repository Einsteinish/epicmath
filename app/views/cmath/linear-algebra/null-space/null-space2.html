<h2>Matrix multiplication that yields <b>0</b> matrix</h2>
<p>The following matrix multiplication example is interesting in that it somehow produces a zero matrix:</p>

<br>
<p>In normal arithmatic, the only way of a number multiplication giving us <b>0</b> is when at least one of the numbers is <b>0</b>.</p> 
<p>But in our case, no matrix is <b>0</b>.</p>
<p>How can that happen?</p>
<p>It's the power of <b>null</b> space!</p>
<p>When we look more carefully, the second matrix is the <b>null</b> space of the first matrix. So, it's equivalent of <b>0</b> in normal number multiplication.</p>
<p>Remember, <b>null</b> space knows how to make a matrix <b>0</b> matrix by working as coeffients for a given linear system.</p>
