<h1>Story about numbers - scale</h1>
<br>
<p>The distance to the moon - about 385,000 km (239,000 mi) from Earth's center:</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>If we ask people about the distance to the moon for a given size of the earth (for example, a basket ball. 
In this case, the moon is about the size of a tennis ball), 9 of out 10 people, put the tennis ball much closer than 30x(diameter of the basket ball). 
Most likely, 5x-10x.</p>

<h1>Logarithmic scale</h1>
<p>We use a logarithmic scale to show the rate of change of the number over time.            
The bottom picture makes it much clearer that the rate of change or growth rate is constant.</p>

<br>
<p>Logarithm scales are often used when there is a large range of values involved with the variables under consideration.</p>

<p>Here is a practical example for the logarithminc scale. Without using the log scale, it's almost imposible to describe the wide range of scale properly:</p>

<br>
<p>Though there are some debates whether the majority of the human sensory system is wired up to respond in log units, there are some cases that may seem to support it.
For example, if we turn on one hair dryer, the room will get much louder, but turning on a second hair dryer won't suddenly make things twice as loud.
We'd need about ten extra hair dryers to double the loudness of the sound. - <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-intuitive-scale-which-guides-human-senses-Is-it-the-logarithmic-scale-or-the-ubiquitously-adopted-linear-scale">What is the intuitive scale which guides human senses? Is it the logarithmic scale or the ubiquitously adopted linear scale?</a></p>

<h1>The smallest scale - Planck Scale</h1>
<p>This scale is so small (10^-35) that we cannnot ceasily comprehend. 
As an analogy, if we think a pea at the center of football field as a neucleus (10^-15m), the size of the football is going to be the size of an atom (10^-10m) 
Now, let's play with the Planck scale.
To do that we need to inflate the football field to observable universe. 
Then, finally the Plank scale is compresensible (though not still visible): the size of an atom becomes the Plank scale.</p>
